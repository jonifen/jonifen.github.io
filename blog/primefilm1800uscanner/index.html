    <p>As part of the downsizing task my Mum has taken on, we&rsquo;ve got a lot of photos and slides to transfer to a digital format that can be viewed on an iPad (or digital photo frame). The photos is an easy task (albeit fairly monotonous as my scanner doesn&rsquo;t have a document feeder), but the slides might be trickier.</p>

<p>My Mum bought a slide scanner a few years ago (OK then, quite a few years ago), the PrimeFilm 1800u Film Scanner. On the box it suggests needing Windows 98 or newer, with a badge saying &ldquo;Works great with Windows XP!&rdquo;. This is all well and good, but who uses Windows XP anymore? Certainly not me! All our machines are Windows 10 or Debian 8, so I was hoping I wouldn&rsquo;t have to install XP onto one of the machines especially.</p>

<p>I got the slide scanner out and installed the drivers onto my laptop (Windows 10 x64). All seemed to go well, except when I tried scanning a slide in using Adobe Photoshop CS3, it failed to find the scanner. I suspected a UAC issue, so ran Photoshop as Administrator (to elevate the scanner software too) but to no avail.</p>

<p>I had a nosey around online and found <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-hardware/primefilm-1800u-film-scanner-need-windows-8-driver/577b09f0-dfa3-4a85-a661-28d3f1b6f669">this post on the Microsoft Forum</a> where Jack Moorhouse gave some excellent advice (copied below for safety):</p>

<ul>
<li>Google &ldquo;How to install unsigned drivers on Windows 10 - By TotallydubbedHD&rdquo; and follow instructions</li>
<li>Download &amp; run the installer for the slide viewer (SF_ENG_1.3.exe) which is for windows up to 7. I ran it in vista sp2 compatibility mode.AT THIS POINT IT STILL DOESN&rsquo;T WORK</li>
<li>Go to control panel -&gt; device manager -&gt;imaging devices and update the driver for the slide viewer from the folder c:\windows\Twain_32\cyberviewX_SF</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;ll tweak the above to what worked for me:</p>

<ul>
<li>I found the advised instructions by TotallydubbedHD on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StkR3D2d5WI">video link</a></li>
<li>I downloaded the drivers from <a href="http://www.avegene.com/sd.php">this website</a> selecting &ldquo;Driver/Firmware&rdquo; &gt; &ldquo;Film Scanners&rdquo; &gt; &ldquo;PrimeFilm 1800u/i &amp; 1800 Silver-DISCONTINUED&rdquo; and then after searching, downloading the Windows driver.</li>
<li>I then installed the drivers - I didn&rsquo;t have to run in compatibility mode as it seemed to cope just fine. However, in Device Manager, it said the drivers hadn&rsquo;t been loaded as they weren&rsquo;t signed.</li>
<li>I followed the TotallydubbedHD advice at this point.</li>
<li>Once I rebooted (after the instructions), I chose to update the driver (via Device Manager) and it installed fine.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only problem I had was with the ButtonKey software - I had to run it as Administrator for it to save the settings (I suspect it&rsquo;s the classic issue where legacy programs are written to save to the registry in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and non-Administrator accounts can&rsquo;t write to this location in Windows Vista and newer). It does work fine through Photoshop though, and the images are scanning in just fine!</p>

<p>The issue I have now is a lack of time&hellip; it&rsquo;s a slow process to scan the slides in one by one!</p>

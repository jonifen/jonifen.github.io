<a href=/tags/windows class=tag>windows</a></div></div></div></div></div><div class=container><div class=content><p>So this week I&rsquo;ve bought an ex-corporate Dell Vostro 3350 with the intention of it replacing Di&rsquo;s aged Pentium D desktop which is struggling since the Windows 10 upgrade.
The laptop came pre-installed with Windows 10 Professional (a digital entitlement upgrade from the Windows 7 Pro that came on the laptop), and seemed quick enough. However, I&rsquo;m not one to use a laptop as it comes, especially when it&rsquo;s not brand new. Plus I noticed some of the devices weren&rsquo;t installed correctly, so I took the opportunity to reinstall on the mechanical disk to ensure I have the right drivers before reinstalling onto the SSD that&rsquo;ll come out of the desktop.</p><p>Let the fun begin!</p><p>So I started by installing Windows 10 Professional x64. So far so good, except I need drivers as nothing seems to be working correctly. Including the wireless. Bizarre.</p><p>So first of all, let&rsquo;s check the BIOS version. Latest version is A10, which is installed. Excellent.</p><p>The wireless adapter detected my SSID, connected to it and even got an IP from DHCP, but had no throughput once connected. I got the drivers from the Dell site (R312132-Intel-Wireless-1702-Wifi-BT3.exe) and installed them. No joy though, it just seemed to kill the wireless adapter entirely. So I plugged in my Edimax nano USB adapter instead which worked great. I&rsquo;ll come back to the wireless later.</p><p>Windows updates kicked in as soon as it got online, it pulled down drivers for the Intel video adapter, and an AMD driver too? I didn&rsquo;t know it had switchable graphics? (It certainly wasn&rsquo;t installed pre-format). But yes, it does have switchable graphics!</p><p>The drivers seemed to work fine, until rebooting the laptop at which point the screen would show the Windows 10 splash screen, before going black for exactly a minute, then re-displaying the splash screen for about 2 seconds and then giving me the login screen. Weird, but definitely driver related. So I grabbed (from the Dell website):</p><ul><li>Vedio_Intel_W84_X00_A01_Setup-5PFY2_ZPE.exe</li><li>Video_ATI_W8_X02_A00_Setup-HJNJ1_ZPE.exe</li></ul><p>and installed them in that order. That fixed the black screen issue during boot-up. Nice!</p><p>Windows update also installed a driver for the Bluetooth/Wireless adapter too, and it revived the adapter, but still with no throughput (back at square one!) so I tried rolling back the driver through Device Manager, and the wireless sprung into life! Very strange, and I can&rsquo;t explain it (as the previous driver version was junk), but it has been working perfectly ever since.</p><p>I continued on to install the other devices, including the fingerprint sensor (which I can&rsquo;t work out how to configure and use!) and the free-fall sensor too.</p><p>So, now it&rsquo;s up and running, what have I got for my money and how does it improve the desktop? Ok, so&hellip;</p><table><thead><tr><td></td><td>Laptop</td><td>Desktop</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Processor (CPU)</td><td>Intel i3-2310M (2 Cores, 4 Threads)</td><td>Intel Pentium D 950 (2 Cores, 2 Threads)</td></tr><tr><td>Memory (RAM)</td><td>2Gb (1x 2Gb) DDR3 SODIMM</td><td>4Gb (4x 1Gb) DDR2</td></tr><tr><td>Video</td><td>Intel HD3000 & AMD 7640M</td><td>AMD HD6670</td></tr><tr><td>Storage (HDD)</td><td>750Gb 5400rpm</td><td>250Gb Sandisk SSD</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>13" laptop, so quite small<br>and surprisingly light!</td><td>Massive.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>So I&rsquo;ve got 8Gb RAM on order (due in a few days). Once that arrives, I&rsquo;ll grab the SSD from the desktop too and reinstall it again. Luckily, the steps I detailed above have been recreated (I reinstalled the laptop again to prove I had the right drivers to create this post!), so all will/should (hopefully!) go according to plan.</p></div></div><footer><div class=container><small><a href=https://jonifen.co.uk>jonifen.co.uk</a> - Created using <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></small></div></footer></div></body></html>

After doing some digging into the problem, it turns out that it could be related to a failed Windows Update that Microsoft initially issued in December 2016, but some computers are slow in picking up the update (or the owners are similar to me, and don&rsquo;t reboot very often to let updates take effect!)</p><p>One thing I must note though, is that while I have seen a PC affected by this, I haven&rsquo;t had the problem on any of my own computers, which puzzled me. However, I did realise that none of my computers are running an upgraded Windows 10 installation, they are all fresh installations of Windows 10. So perhaps this is part of the make-up of the issue?</p><p>The Register have created a few posts which give some useful information to get to the bottom of the problem, the best one being this one: <a href=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/12/12/ongoing_windows_8_10_dhcp_problems_affecting_all_isps/>http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/12/12/ongoing_windows_8_10_dhcp_problems_affecting_all_isps/</a></p><p>So the official resolution is to reboot the computer&mldr; and if that doesn&rsquo;t resolve the issue, reboot again&mldr; and so on&mldr; until it fixes the issue. Which seems a bit crazy. So the alternative solution offered on The Register&rsquo;s article is probably a nicer option, so let&rsquo;s try that.</p><p>You need to open a Command Prompt window as an Administrator, which you can do as follows:</p><ul><li><p>Click your Start button and type in <code>cmd</code> before pressing CTRL+ALT+ENTER together. This will pop up the UAC prompt to ensure that you do want to run the process as an Administrator. Click Yes to continue.</p></li><li><p>In the window that appears, type in the following commands. One line at a time, pressing Enter after each line:</p><pre><code> netsh winsock reset catalog
 netsh int ipv4 reset reset.log
</code></pre></li><li><p>Now reboot your computer. Make sure you actually restart the computer (as compared to doing a Shutdown/Power off and then power it back on).</p></li></ul><p>In the cases I&rsquo;ve had to look at, it&rsquo;s been a successful fix, so you <em>should</em> hopefully be back in business once the computer loads back up. However, if it hasn&rsquo;t resolved your problem, then head back to the website I linked to above (The Register) and see if there are any updates from people in the comments section at the bottom of the page.</p><p>Enjoy!</p></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=footer-icons><a href=https://github.com/jonifen/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=icon-github></span></a><a href=https://twitter.com/jonifen/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=icon-twitter></span></a><a href=https://linkedin.com/in/jonifen/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=icon-linkedin2></span></a><a href=https://www.reddit.com/user/jonifen target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=icon-reddit></span></a><a href=http://stackoverflow.com/users/3157725/jonifen target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=icon-stackoverflow></span></a><a href="mailto:hello@jonifen.co.uk?subject=Contact%20from%20your%20website" target=_blank><span class=icon-mail2></span></a></div><p><a href=https://jonifen.co.uk>jonifen.co.uk</a> - Created using <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></p></div></footer></div></body></html>

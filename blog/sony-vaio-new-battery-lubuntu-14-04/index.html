    <p>The genuine battery died a few months back on the &ldquo;bricktop&rdquo; (a Sony Vaio C2M/W), and with the hard drive starting to click, I just dumped it on the side and gave up with it. After trying to persist with an Atom N450 netbook (Visual Studio usage is soul-destroying on an Atom CPU!), I&rsquo;ve dug it back out and ordered a new battery from Amazon and the Intel 40Gb SSD that was on offer at Ebuyer for 20 quid.</p>

<p>Anyway, the SSD is yet to arrive, but the battery arrived today. Clipped it in and it&rsquo;s not a perfect fit (the clips don&rsquo;t fully engage and it&rsquo;s a black battery in an otherwise silver chassis) but that&rsquo;s not too big an issue&hellip; as long as it works right?</p>

<p>So, the laptop powered on but Lubuntu wouldn&rsquo;t boot. It seemed to be hanging after grub with a black screen. Plugging the AC Adapter in to reboot sorted it, and I can unplug after it&rsquo;s booted and run on battery OK. It just wouldn&rsquo;t boot on battery.</p>

<p>Eventually, I tried a few different things. Amending the /etc/default/grub file to remove &ldquo;quiet splash&rdquo; from the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT property didn&rsquo;t solve the problem. I&rsquo;ve found setting it to &ldquo;acpi=off&rdquo; works, but that&rsquo;s a little drastic as I lose battery details, so I&rsquo;ve changed it to &ldquo;nolapic&rdquo; and all seems fine. So in the end, I had to do the following:</p>

<pre><code>sudo nano /etc/default/grub
</code></pre>

<p>Change the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT property to be &ldquo;nolapic&rdquo;, save the file (CTRL+O) and exit back to bash (CTRL+X). Then run:</p>

<pre><code>sudo update-grub
</code></pre>

<p>Which updates the grub menu list with the new setting, and then I rebooted with the AC Adapter unplugged.</p>

<p>So far, so good&hellip; I have battery info and I can even change screen brightness from the keyboard shortcuts (Fn+F5/F6) - something I couldn&rsquo;t do in Windows without a load of Sony crapware!</p>

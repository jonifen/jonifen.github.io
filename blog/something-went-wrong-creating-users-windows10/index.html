    <p>On a fresh install of Windows 10, I found I was unable to add a second user to the system (via All Settings) and constantly got the &ldquo;Something went wrong&rdquo; screen. I tried a few reboots but to no avail.
A quick google found that a lot of people with laptops were having this problem, and removing the battery and running on AC power only appeared to resolve their problem, but I&rsquo;m on a desktop&hellip; i.e. no battery.</p>

<p>So I reverted to an alternative route, by running (via Windows Key+R):</p>

<pre><code>control userpasswords2
</code></pre>

<p>and added the new user inside there.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, that works fine. But when I tried the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; route again (via All Settings), it appears something went wrong again. Very strange! But I got my account added anyway, so it&rsquo;s all good :-)</p>

<p><strong>Update - 31/10/2015</strong>
I&rsquo;ve since found that the profile created using the above method was unable to open JPG files into the Microsoft Photos app, instead getting the error &ldquo;Invalid value for registry&rdquo; appearing onscreen.
I tried a few things, including a powershell command to reinstall all pre-installed Windows Store apps (Photos/Mail etc.) but it was all to no avail.
Eventually, I removed the account from the existing admin account, and it let me recreate it through the normal route (via All Settings) without any hassle. Funnily enough, everything works now! (Have I just jinxed it by saying this?!)</p>

      <title>Convert JavaScript Number to Number Array</title>
      <link>/blog/post/2019/js_number_to_array/</link>

      <description>I had a number which I wanted converting into an array where each digit of the number was an item in the array. I tried a few different ways of doing this but always ended up with a string array which wasn&amp;rsquo;t what I wanted.
To get around this, you can use some of the new features introduced in ES6 as follows:
const theNumber = 432375; const output = Array.from(theNumber.toString()).map(Number); console.</description>

      <title>Dell XPS 15 9530 limited CPU clock speed (0.78GHz)</title>

      <description>This morning, I noticed that my Dell XPS 15 9530 felt a little sluggish, so did some investigation and found the CPU clock had capped at a lower speed. I did a full reboot of Windows 10, and luckily this was sufficient to shake things back into life. But a quick read online suggested that some people aren&amp;rsquo;t quite as lucky in this situation.
So if a reboot doesn&amp;rsquo;t resolve the issue, what next?</description>

      <description>Have you ever had one of those days when you&amp;rsquo;ve been hard at work on a repository, making small and regular commits to the repository during the day only to decide that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the way you wanted to go? So how do you get back to where you were at the beginning of the day?
Well, you could just revert each commit one-by-one, but what if your commit history is like this?</description>

      <description>We have an existing web application project at work which was failing to open in Visual Studio 2019 with the following error:
The imported project &amp;quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Professional\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\vCurrent\WebApplications\Microsoft.WebApplication.targets&amp;quot; was not found.  After some research, I came across this a VS Community post where Microsoft have deemed it to be under consideration, but after a few months, it&amp;rsquo;s still outstanding.
Figuring out that the issue could surround the vCurrent part of the path, I did a bit more research, coming across another VS Community post which discusses this point, and it turns out that Microsoft have changed the MSBuildToolsVersion variable to output Current rather than the version (as it did previously).</description>

      <description>Previously at work, our marketing websites were all designed up front, with copy provided by our colleagues in Marketing and then the pages were generated by the development teams. Because this was taking our developers away from the tasks where they can add real value to the customer journey by streamlining the end-to-end process, it was decided that the company would benefit from introducing a CMS solution with which the Marketing team and Content Writers would be able to manage content themselves.</description>

      <description>Git is easily the best source control system I&amp;rsquo;ve ever used, yet it&amp;rsquo;s probably one of the more infuriating too because its power and flexibility can also land the users in a whole world of pain.
Today at work we had a scenario where a colleague needed to revert a handful of commits including a merge but there was a chance it may need re-introducing at a later date. I suggested reverting each commit with --no-commit but nobody else had heard of this argument before, hence I felt a post may be useful (although this probably requires that people visit my blog first to find it haha).</description>

      <description>Our continuous delivery setup at work requires that we use bash scripts for builds that can be handled by Linux machines.
The main issue is when we create a new project, we often get &amp;ldquo;Permission Denied&amp;rdquo; errors when the CI system runs the scripts on the build agents. Usually, you&amp;rsquo;d just run chmod on a machine and try again, but this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work when the files are being pushed into a git repository, and then pulled at the other side.</description>

      <guid>/blog/post/2019/hp-dm1-4027-arch-linux/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started to use a HP DM1-4027ea as a replacement for the Asus Eee 1005P netbook. The 4Gb RAM (upgradable to 8Gb) and more powerful CPU/GPU combo meant that it should give reasonable performance where the Eee struggles (downloading npm modules and browsing script/image heavy websites).
The HP DM1-4027ea comes with an AMD E-450 APU which consists of a dual core 1.6GHz CPU and a Radeon HD6320 GPU, so on paper should still be acceptable for current mobile demands.</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on creating an implementation of Umbraco CMS for the Marketing team at work to use for quickly creating content for promotions etc. and the SEO Manager has asked what we could implement to benefit them in terms of SEO (Search Engine Optimisation for those who don&amp;rsquo;t know).
Requirements Now, until working on this, I knew what SEO was, but had no idea what it entailed, so working with the SEO Manager, we outlined the following requirements for our initial (MVP) release.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written loads of unit tests in my lifetime for C# and JavaScript, but never gotten around to writing any for testing the actual React components because there&amp;rsquo;s always been something more pressing. Time to put that right and take the plunge.
So I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up the project which resulted from the React.js Continued&amp;hellip; State! tutorial as a starter for ten as it already has a lot of the boilerplate stuff in place.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not a big DIY-er, but I do have a go from time to time. After having some home improvements work done on our house which included removing the chimney throughout the house, we&amp;rsquo;re in need of a TV aerial. We have Sky as our main TV supply on the main TV, but in the bedrooms, we relied on the aerial, so I needed to find a solution fairly soon.</description>

      <description>ECMAScript 6&amp;frasl;2015 has brought a lot of new things to the world of JavaScript, and Map() is one of them. However, not all browsers are too keen on particular ways of using it.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a UI project at work this week and encountered a weird issue with some code written by a colleague. We have some scenarios in our React app where we need to translate/map some values from an integer to a string (for textual display in the rendered screen).</description>

      <description>I have an aging iPad2 which is getting on a bit but still works fine, but often won&amp;rsquo;t appear in iTunes, but is showing in Windows 10 as a device in &amp;lsquo;This PC&amp;rsquo;.
I find it usually happens after an iTunes update when the iPad was plugged in already, and it seems Windows throws in a generic driver when the Apple drivers are removed as part of the upgrade process. To solve the problem, I do the following:</description>

      <title>Rendering an array of data as a clickable list using React.js</title>

      <description>React.js is great for quickly rendering arrays of data in a tabular format, and there&amp;rsquo;s loads of grid-like packages out there in npm, but sometimes you just need to hand-crank something yourself. Which is fine, until you want the row to be clickable&amp;hellip;
So how would you usually render a page from an array of data? Well, I&amp;rsquo;d probably start with some form of iterating the array and building up the content that way.</description>

      <description>As part of the downsizing task my Mum has taken on, we&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot of photos and slides to transfer to a digital format that can be viewed on an iPad (or digital photo frame). The photos is an easy task (albeit fairly monotonous as my scanner doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a document feeder), but the slides might be trickier.
My Mum bought a slide scanner a few years ago (OK then, quite a few years ago), the PrimeFilm 1800u Film Scanner.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve created a few pages on here which are now growing into a bit of a tutorial, so thought I&amp;rsquo;d collate the links into one post (and append links to any new related posts in the future) so it&amp;rsquo;s easier to follow.
So to start off, I&amp;rsquo;ll rewind back to November 2015, when I created my Getting Started with React.js post. This was using JSX and ES5, along with Browserify to &amp;ldquo;compile&amp;rdquo; the code to &amp;ldquo;Vanilla JS&amp;rdquo; which the web browsers support.</description>

      <description>This time I&amp;rsquo;ll be looking at State. What it is and how to use it&amp;hellip; Like last time, we&amp;rsquo;ll be continuing with the code from the previous post.
Last time we created 2 components, home (which was a stateful component) and header (which was a stateless component). This time we&amp;rsquo;re going to handle state within the home component by calling an API. As in previous posts, I&amp;rsquo;ll be using the UK Police API as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any authentication (or at least it doesn&amp;rsquo;t at the moment, that could change!</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to continue on from my React.js Revisited post that I made a few days ago. This time we&amp;rsquo;ll look at creating some components&amp;hellip;
So what exactly is a &amp;ldquo;Component&amp;rdquo; in the context of React.js? In my head, I visualise React.js a little like Web UI Lego. The idea is you build your web application in blocks which are then built in a way which suits you and your application.</description>

      <description>Sometimes the version of an npm package has some functionality you want, but it has issues which break other stuff. What do you do? Pull the repo and build it yourself and shoehorn it in? Let&amp;rsquo;s see&amp;hellip;
For my example, I&amp;rsquo;ll use the griddle-react package.
I quite like the Griddle component (griddle-react), I&amp;rsquo;ve posted about it in the past, and use it both at work and in side-projects at home whenever tabular data needs to be displayed as it&amp;rsquo;s quick and simple.</description>

      <description>Visual Studio 2015 (by default) isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly crash hot for editing JavaScript, especially JSX/ES6 for React etc.
A lot of developers seem to opt for alternative IDEs/editors for writing JavaScript code instead of staying in Visual Studio, however it&amp;rsquo;s often more effort to manage multiple IDEs for one project. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a few things myself to get things working, some of the steps below are courtesy of Nick Dewitt on this StackOverflow post.</description>

Although it recovers successfully, it&amp;rsquo;s still pretty annoying. A couple of days ago, I finally reached the end of my tether and started seriously looking for a solution (as compared to a quick Google search and then get distracted).
I came across a thread on Dell&amp;rsquo;s community forum: http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3519/t/19658452 which discussed this problem.</description>

I had a look around online, comparing advice to the settings on his phone, and all seemed fine, but it still asked for this password.
Earlier this morning, I did a backup, a factory reset and a backup restore.</description>

      <title>Dell Vostro 3350 Laptop with Windows 10</title>

      <description>So this week I&amp;rsquo;ve bought an ex-corporate Dell Vostro 3350 with the intention of it replacing Di&amp;rsquo;s aged Pentium D desktop which is struggling since the Windows 10 upgrade. The laptop came pre-installed with Windows 10 Professional (a digital entitlement upgrade from the Windows 7 Pro that came on the laptop), and seemed quick enough. However, I&amp;rsquo;m not one to use a laptop as it comes, especially when it&amp;rsquo;s not brand new.</description>

      <description>Twice recently I&amp;rsquo;ve reinstalled Windows 7 on a machine, only for Windows Update to fail when checking for updates. On both machines it gave an error 8007000E.
The first machine (belonging to my nephew), I couldn&amp;rsquo;t fix, so left it with him with automatic updates enabled in the hope it&amp;rsquo;ll fix itself.
The second machine is this Samsung netbook. As it&amp;rsquo;s already had me over a barrel, it won&amp;rsquo;t do me over again!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had to do a restore on a Samsung NC10+ which is an Atom N450 based netbook from a few years back. But for some reason, the recovery stuff just won&amp;rsquo;t work and I&amp;rsquo;ve had to do a clean install of Windows. And the Samsung support website&amp;hellip; well, it&amp;rsquo;s not much support at all. In fact, I don&amp;rsquo;t think they even remember releasing the NC10+. Only the original NC10.</description>

Usually I&amp;rsquo;d just include an addendum at the bottom, but I&amp;rsquo;ve re-worded a few bits in the content as my original review was maybe a tad harsh, and I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why below. It&amp;rsquo;s just a shame it took so long for the Marshmallow update to be available, as I&amp;rsquo;d already had enough with the handset and wanted back to an Apple where things are just simple!</description>

      <description>My son bought an Android tablet around 18 months ago with a combination of Christmas and Birthday money. It became an extension of his body with him taking it everywhere to play games and watch YouTube videos about Minecraft and Garry&amp;rsquo;s Mod.
He recently leapt into bed one night (forgetting the tablet was on his bed) and broke the screen with his knee. It was a complete accident, but he was absolutely devastated by what had happened.</description>

      <description>As mentioned in my last post, I was in the hunt for a new router to replace the aging Buffalo WHR-HP-G54. I&amp;rsquo;d found that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t capable of handling fibre broadband speeds (hardly surprising&amp;hellip; given that it&amp;rsquo;s running a 200MHz single core CPU with barely a few megs free of the 16Mb RAM).
I ended up dropping by PC World and picking up the TP-Link Archer C2 for £49.99 (a few quid more expensive than it was at Scan, but PC World was closer, so I was saving petrol money and around 30 minutes of my time for the round-trip).</description>

      <description>Out of contract with my previous supplier, I was free to find a new supplier. Luckily, one of the benefits of my job is that I get free fibre broadband, so it was a simple decision :)
Anyway, back to the point of my post.
I last used the Buffalo a few years back when on Virgin Media&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;National&amp;rdquo; service (no longer available - a good thing as it was trash) when their supplied Netgear had weak wi-fi.</description>

Being a Dad, this time of year is never exactly the right time to blow out big money on a new phone for myself so that&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait for the new year. But I&amp;rsquo;ve got hold of my daughter&amp;rsquo;s old iPhone 5c to use in the meantime.</description>

      <description>It seems whenever I need to make a phone call on the landline, it&amp;rsquo;s broken. Yesterday I picked up the landline handset and it was dead. No dial tone. Nothing. Nada. Zip.
I tried the usual steps at first (unplug it, plug it back in) but no joy. Onto the broadband I went. Works fine. Weird. I&amp;rsquo;ve had this before and leaving stuff unplugged overnight seemed to fix it, but on this occasion it didn&amp;rsquo;t help.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve just tried editing a markdown file in Visual Studio and they have a cracking auto-preview on the right hand side of the page! Granted, you have to save the file to get the preview to update, but hey, I can live with that! This will make things a lot easier given that I&amp;rsquo;m currently keeping my content markdown stored in a TFS repository. Seems daft to make a post so small, but I was impressed.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a while at various blogging engines for my website and came across Hugo which is a static page generator. The bonus of this is that I don&amp;rsquo;t have a demand on any SQL databases, nor do I have to remember a password every time I want to update the site. Unfortunately, this does mean I&amp;rsquo;m tied to a computer for updating the page all the time. I&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can find a way around that though if I get chance :)</description>

      <description>While working on the Griddle functionality at work, we needed to throw in some inline styling (just to test something out quickly). Unfortunately, with React, this isn&amp;rsquo;t as straightforward as just throwing in a style attribute with a few values.
The React documentation does explain this, but I&amp;rsquo;m not impressed with having to create a variable just for a quick sweaty test of something. Instead, you can do this:
&amp;lt;div style={{&amp;quot;height&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;100%&amp;quot;}}&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;  By putting the style markup inside double curly braces, it does away with the requirement for another variable, which makes it ideal for quickly testing a new style.</description>

      <description>We had a requirement at work to display some tabular data that is retrieved from a web service as a JSON object. As we have recently started using React, it made sense to find a decent component that suited what we needed and after a bit of browsing, we found Griddle.
Unfortunately, their documentation; while it wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad, it&amp;rsquo;s not the best I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d throw something together to show how to get it working quickly and using a publicly available API, so anyone should be able to follow.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been following the &amp;ldquo;Getting Started&amp;rdquo; tutorials on the ReactJS website. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit&amp;hellip; errr&amp;hellip; bizarre to be honest! It does say that the way it does things is a little odd, and to give it 5 minutes and then make a decision. Despite this &amp;ldquo;odd-ness&amp;rdquo; though, it&amp;rsquo;s become really popular, so it&amp;rsquo;s well worth having a look at.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been having a few problems with the tutorial though. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain where things haven&amp;rsquo;t gone well and what I did to fix it.</description>

      <description>Google brings up a complete bag of results when you search for &amp;ldquo;svchost high cpu&amp;rdquo; as it&amp;rsquo;s been a well documented issue with the Windows Update service across the last couple of Windows versions (way back to XP as it happens!) so it was little surprise to find that the instance of svchost.exe that was eating CPU cycles was the one that was hosting the Windows Update service.
Dipping into the Settings screens of Windows 10, I got to the Windows Update section, only for it to show that it was on &amp;ldquo;Downloading Updates 0%&amp;rdquo; and remained at this point for a couple of hours without moving.</description>

After researching online, I found that doing the following fixes it: + Close Outlook before continuing. + Run a command prompt as administrator + Run sfc /scannow and allow to complete.</description>

I use an app for my online banking. When I load it up, it complains that there is no security product installed. If I open up McAfee manually, and go back into my banking app, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t complain.</description>

After a quick search, I came across a report on the RaspberryPi Github where someone else was having the exact same problem where the mouse was moving &amp;ldquo;in slow motion&amp;rdquo;.</description>

The build quality is excellent, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t flex at all if you hold it by a corner when it&amp;rsquo;s open. The keyboard took a little getting used to, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly and my typing speed is increasing every time I use it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending some time recently to learn WPF a bit better including the MVVM pattern to encourage the separation of concerns between the view and the logic behind it.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a steep learning curve (to say the least!) but today I spent a bit of time looking into getting an Office-esque ribbon bar onto the main window of my dummy application. At first I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too sure, but I soon realised it&amp;rsquo;s not too dissimilar to any other button.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s finally arrived!
I was getting to the point of wondering if it would ever get here or if it would stay in the limbo land between the factory and the courier in the UK.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had it a couple of days now and did the usual charging process (1st charge to full while setting it up etc.). I&amp;rsquo;ve since used it for around 5hrs on battery and at 12% decided to do the 2nd charge.</description>

      <description>OK, so I&amp;rsquo;m not alone here. I finally decided on an XPS 15 and ordered it 10 days ago now. After a couple of days, the Dell website showed the order as shipped and I could track it through their agent Walsh Western (a.k.a. Syncreon). I&amp;rsquo;m now sat here on the evening before my expected ETA date and it still hasn&amp;rsquo;t reached the UK. The last update is the common &amp;ldquo;DEPARTED MANU.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s just never easy when you&amp;rsquo;re picky like me.
So as you&amp;rsquo;ll have noticed from my previous posts, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using my wife&amp;rsquo;s Asus 1005P (Atom CPU) and a 7 year old Vaio C2M/W. Over the last month or so I&amp;rsquo;ve been suffering from a &amp;ldquo;crisis of confidence&amp;rdquo; where I&amp;rsquo;ve been asking how I managed to become a senior developer. After reading Scott Hanselman&amp;rsquo;s blog on the topic, it seems that it&amp;rsquo;s a common feeling amongst developers.</description>

      <description>Since installing Update 2 on the work laptop, I&amp;rsquo;ve been unable to check for available updates through the Tools &amp;gt; Extensions &amp;amp; Updates screen as it always timed out. If I continued working (without closing the IDE), it would eventually prompt me through the Notifications pane that it required credentials for the company proxy. Once I did that, it&amp;rsquo;d report updates etc. but over the last couple of days, that is no longer happening either.</description>

      <title>Sony Vaio C2M/W, Lubuntu 14.04 and a new battery</title>

      <description>The genuine battery died a few months back on the &amp;ldquo;bricktop&amp;rdquo; (a Sony Vaio C2M/W), and with the hard drive starting to click, I just dumped it on the side and gave up with it. After trying to persist with an Atom N450 netbook (Visual Studio usage is soul-destroying on an Atom CPU!), I&amp;rsquo;ve dug it back out and ordered a new battery from Amazon and the Intel 40Gb SSD that was on offer at Ebuyer for 20 quid.</description>

      <description>I have a Canon 350D which I was struggling to download the photos from onto the computer since upgrading it to Windows 7 64-bit. I&amp;rsquo;d looked around for drivers, but Canon haven&amp;rsquo;t made any 64-bit drivers for that camera (we have had it nearly 8 years) so I was wondering how I&amp;rsquo;d get around the problem. I eventually came across the site of someone else in the same situation who has blogged the following:</description>

      <title>Raspberry Pi on a 19&#34; Widescreen (16:10) LCD Monitor</title>

      <description>Earlier today I booked places for me and my son on a Raspberry Pi day in Manchester and then realised I might struggle to get the TV there as it&amp;rsquo;s pretty heavy, plus I doubt we&amp;rsquo;d be allowed it on a bus! Luckily, we still have the 19&amp;rdquo; widescreen from the old living room PC, so I looked at using that instead.
The monitor was made by Daewoo, I got it about 6 years ago (or there abouts) and it has a native resolution of 1440x900 at a refresh rate of 60Hz.</description>

      <description>I was lucky enough at Christmas for my wife to surprise me with a Raspberry Pi. I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted one for some time but never got around to actually ordering one. My wife always asks me when she&amp;rsquo;s faced with techie decisions which made it an even bigger surprise.
Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last few days getting it up and running but my son realised earlier that it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have any sound coming through the TV set, so I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the last couple of hours reading and trying stuff out and I think I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten to the bottom of the problem.</description>

      <description>So it&amp;rsquo;s the end of a long Sunday which started later than expected (as I&amp;rsquo;d slept in despite my son&amp;rsquo;s best efforts to wake me with the ever-loud playback of YouTube videos). I&amp;rsquo;ve spent most of the day glaring at a computer screen but not for productive gain as it&amp;rsquo;s my family duty to fix the broken computers of the children/parents/siblings, except this time it&amp;rsquo;s been a looonnnnggg job which Windows XP is just aching to make so much worse.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re not able to continually upgrade our Creative Suite version every time a new one comes out, so we&amp;rsquo;re still on CS3. Unfortunately though, I installed an SSD in the desktop yesterday which of course meant reinstalling it with CS3 from the discs. Everything seemed fine until I tried to run an update, at which point it complained with the following message:
There are no updates available at this time. Please note that some updates for the following products cannot be determined at this time: Adobe Updater</description>

      <description>So I finally got around to sorting out my page. This is only a quick update to kick things off. There will be the typical random stuff, but also programming stuff as well (which should help other programmers (new and existing) that are struggling to find what they&amp;rsquo;re looking for).</description>

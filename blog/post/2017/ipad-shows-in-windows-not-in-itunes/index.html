    <p>I have an aging iPad2 which is getting on a bit but still works fine, but often won&rsquo;t appear in iTunes, but is showing in Windows 10 as a device in &lsquo;This PC&rsquo;.</p>

<p>I find it usually happens after an iTunes update when the iPad was plugged in already, and it seems Windows throws in a generic driver when the Apple drivers are removed as part of the upgrade process. To solve the problem, I do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unplug the iPad from the computer and close iTunes.</li>
<li>Go to &ldquo;Apps &amp; Features&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Programs &amp; Features&rdquo; in an earlier Windows version) and find &ldquo;Apple Mobile Device Support&rdquo;. Click it and choose &ldquo;Modify&rdquo;.</li>
<li>In the screens that appear, select &ldquo;Repair&rdquo; and continue. It should reinstall the drivers needed for iTunes to recognise the iPad.</li>
<li>Once complete, plug the iPad back in and enjoy being able to sync the iPad in iTunes again!</li>
</ul>

<p>This is how I got it to work, if you&rsquo;re finding other ways also work well, give me a shout through Twitter and I&rsquo;ll give credit on here for any alternative solutions.</p>

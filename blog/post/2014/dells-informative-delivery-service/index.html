    <p>OK, so I&rsquo;m not alone here. I finally decided on an XPS 15 and ordered it 10 days ago now. After a couple of days, the Dell website showed the order as shipped and I could track it through their agent Walsh Western (a.k.a. Syncreon). I&rsquo;m now sat here on the evening before my expected ETA date and it still hasn&rsquo;t reached the UK. The last update is the common &ldquo;DEPARTED MANU.FACILITY&rdquo; which appears to be in China. Apparently this is normal in most cases and it might still turn up tomorrow, but how much should I believe it?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d have expected a company the size of Dell to have a delivery process held in much higher regard. Rumour on the &lsquo;net is that Dell ship in bulk to the UK (expected given the expense of shipping items piece-meal), but why can&rsquo;t they just be upfront about it?</p>

<p>It <em>should</em> come tomorrow, but we&rsquo;ll see so watch this space!</p>

<p><strong>Edit (<sup>17</sup>&frasl;<sub>06</sub>):</strong> So it didn&rsquo;t arrive, but then again I&rsquo;m not surprised. The status page at Syncreon hasn&rsquo;t updated all day, so I called them and got told that they haven&rsquo;t been given the package from Dell yet. Once they get it, as it&rsquo;s only 1 box, the delivery process should be quick. Still doesn&rsquo;t explain how the laptop was &ldquo;Shipped&rdquo; (Dell&rsquo;s language, not mine) on the 10th and we&rsquo;re now on the 17th and the courier still doesn&rsquo;t have it.</p>

<p><strong>Edit #2 (<sup>17</sup>&frasl;<sub>06</sub>):</strong> After digging on Dell&rsquo;s website, I notice they&rsquo;ve issued a Service Tag for my laptop, and that shows the shipped date of the <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>06</sub>. Which means my 12 month warranty is ticking away and it&rsquo;s not even been picked up by the courier! Think I&rsquo;ll need to have words with Dell on this one!</p>

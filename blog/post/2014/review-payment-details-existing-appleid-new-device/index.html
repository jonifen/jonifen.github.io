    <p>My daughter has this week got a new iPhone 5C and has been trying to download apps onto it. However, when she logs into her Apple ID on the 5C, she&rsquo;s prompted to review her payment details. In the list that appears, there is no &ldquo;None&rdquo; option available, and she doesn&rsquo;t want to enter her card details (for which I don&rsquo;t blame her - I haven&rsquo;t entered mine on my Apple ID either!)</p>

<p>She logged into her Apple ID through iTunes on the PC and it again asked to review the details. On doing this, the &ldquo;None&rdquo; option is there to select! Followed the steps and clicked to save and all is working fine now. Just had to re-log into the Apple ID on the phone but apps are downloading successfully. Problem solved!</p>

<p><strong>Update (09/02/2015):</strong> At the weekend, I set up a new iPad for my mother in law with a new Apple account. They now provide a &ldquo;None&rdquo; option for payment method, which is a welcomed change! Thanks Apple :)</p>

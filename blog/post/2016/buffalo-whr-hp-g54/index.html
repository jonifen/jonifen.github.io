<p>Out of contract with my previous supplier, I was free to find a new supplier. Luckily, one of the benefits of my job is that I get free fibre broadband, so it was a simple decision :)</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the point of my post.</p>

<p>I last used the Buffalo a few years back when on Virgin Media&rsquo;s &ldquo;National&rdquo; service (no longer available - a good thing as it was trash) when their supplied Netgear had weak wi-fi. Since then, there&rsquo;s been well documented problems with OpenSSL and the <a href="http://heartbleed.com">Heartbleed</a> vulnerability and I was sure that the Tomato firmware running on the Buffalo would be affected. It turned out that as I was using an official release, <a href="http://wisercoder.com/router-affected-heartbleed-bug">I was OK</a> but I still fancied trying <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com">DD-WRT</a> as it was the original reason for me buying the Buffalo in the first place.</p>

<p>To make the switch, I had to reset the NVRAM on the router, and then <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=71220">re-flash back to stock Buffalo firmware</a>, reset the NVRAM again, flashing DD-WRT and finally resetting the NVRAM <em>again</em> afterwards.</p>

<p>Everything went well and I was ready for installation day!</p>

<h3 id="installation-day">Installation Day!</h3>

<p>The Openreach engineer came and installed their modem and said everything was up and running and I should expect speeds of around <sup>74</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub> based off his line tests. Errr&hellip; nope! However, I&rsquo;ve since found that the Buffalo router is struggling a little with performance. Wireless <strong>coverage</strong> is very good (as expected) but throughput is <em>very</em> weak, often dropping to 16Mbps (the router is G rated i.e. 54Mbps).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it didn&rsquo;t stop there as wired performance was equally weak, maxing out at ~32Mbps downstream, but upstream wasn&rsquo;t around expected at around 18Mbps.</p>

<p>So I took the Buffalo out of the equation, plugging the PC into the modem and firing up a PPPoE connection and ran the tests. Wow, what a difference! I&rsquo;m now looking at ~68Mbps downstream, but the same sort of upstream (~18Mbps). As experienced by <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=28049">other</a> <a href="http://www.linksysinfo.org/index.php?threads/whr-hp-g54-deadly-slow-and-weak.69741">people</a> on the Internet, it&rsquo;s becoming obvious the Buffalo can&rsquo;t cope and needs replacing :&lsquo;(</p>

<h3 id="router-replacements">Router Replacements</h3>

<p>So as I&rsquo;m looking at replacements, I want to make sure I get something that&rsquo;ll do a decent job for a long time. My requirements are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gigabit Ethernet connections</li>
<li>Wireless-N (as a minimum)</li>
<li>Must be capable of a PPPoE connection over Ethernet (so this meant it was essentially a &ldquo;cable router&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Must be capable of restricting Internet access to certain devices (so my son can&rsquo;t spend all night watching Minecraft videos on YouTube on his tablet)</li>
</ul>

<p>Since looking into new routers, I&rsquo;ve found the following out:</p>

<ul>
<li>5GHz was finally &ldquo;a thing&rdquo; available to the mass market</li>
<li>It was possible to have a router running on 2.4GHz and 5GHz simultaneously</li>
<li>I could get a router with USB ports in to create mini-servers for hosting stuff on FTP (this would be <em>very</em> useful!) or making a regular USB printer accessible wirelessly (I wish I&rsquo;d known this a few months ago :angry:)</li>
</ul>

<p>So my requirements list grew&hellip; and eventually I ended up looking at Â£100+ routers. Ouch. Best drag that back a bit!</p>

<p>A recommendation from a colleague means that I&rsquo;ll try to pick up a TP-Link router tomorrow - it seems to have everything on my requirements list. Watch this space!</p>

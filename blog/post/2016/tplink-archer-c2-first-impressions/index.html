    <p>As mentioned in my <a href="http://jonifen.co.uk/post/2016/buffalo-whr-hp-g54/">last post</a>, I was in the hunt for a new router to replace the aging Buffalo WHR-HP-G54. I&rsquo;d found that it wasn&rsquo;t capable of handling fibre broadband speeds (hardly surprising&hellip; given that it&rsquo;s running a 200MHz single core CPU with barely a few megs free of the 16Mb RAM).</p>

<p>I ended up dropping by PC World and picking up the TP-Link Archer C2 for Â£49.99 (a few quid more expensive than it was at Scan, but PC World was closer, so I was saving petrol money and around 30 minutes of my time for the round-trip).</p>

<p>So&hellip; first impressions&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s a bit of a brute! I&rsquo;ve owned much smaller routers in the past. It&rsquo;s not quite as beasty as the Linksys we once had, but it definitely takes up a little more desk space.</li>
<li>Mmmm&hellip; shiny! The pattern on the top of quite nice. I think they call it &ldquo;piano black&rdquo; when it&rsquo;s all glossy.</li>
<li>It will attract dust and fingerprints worse than a monitor screen :(</li>
</ul>

<p>So on with the setup! It actually went really easily. The router has a decent wizard process to follow where you select the connection type (I picked PPPoE and provided my login credentials), the wireless settings (enabling security&hellip; of course!) and then it was all up and running. One minor complaint is that it didn&rsquo;t prompt me to change the login details from the defaults of admin/admin. I did however manage to do that myself through the configuration pages.</p>

<p>So did it solve the issue I was having with the downstream speeds being restricted? Hell yeah! A quick speed test afterwards gave me a result of 68.6Mbps downstream and 18.8Mbps upstream. Which was nice.</p>

    <p>We&rsquo;re not able to continually upgrade our Creative Suite version every time a new one comes out, so we&rsquo;re still on CS3. Unfortunately though, I installed an SSD in the desktop yesterday which of course meant reinstalling it with CS3 from the discs. Everything seemed fine until I tried to run an update, at which point it complained with the following message:</p>

<p><em>There are no updates available at this time.</em>
<em>Please note that some updates for the following products cannot be determined at this time: Adobe Updater</em></p>

<p>I thought it a bit odd as I know that Photoshop has updated in the past following an install, so I couldn&rsquo;t understand what was wrong.</p>

<p>So a quick peek on the Internet and Bing came to the rescue with this link on the <a href="http://forums.adobe.com/thread/941381">Adobe Community Forum</a>.</p>

<p>It seems all I have to do is set the system clock back to before 1st June 2011 and re-run the updater and all will work fine.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, it did work fine so now I&rsquo;m wondering who decided to hard code a date after which point the application would declare there were no updates available! Seems strange to me, but at least it sorted the problem out!</p>

        I had a number which I wanted converting into an array where each digit of the number was an item in the array. I tried a few different ways of doing this but always ended up with a string array which wasn&rsquo;t what I wanted.
To get around this, you can use some of the new features introduced in ES6 as follows:
const theNumber = 432375; const output = Array.from(theNumber.toString()).map(Number); console.

        This morning, I noticed that my Dell XPS 15 9530 felt a little sluggish, so did some investigation and found the CPU clock had capped at a lower speed...

        Have you ever had one of those days when you&#39;ve been hard at work on a repository, making small and regular commits to the repository during the day only to decide that it wasn&#39;t the way you wanted to go...

  <p>
    
      
        We have an existing web application project at work which was failing to open in Visual Studio 2019 with the following error:
The imported project &quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Professional\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\vCurrent\WebApplications\Microsoft.WebApplication.targets&quot; was not found.  After some research, I came across this a VS Community post where Microsoft have deemed it to be under consideration, but after a few months, it&rsquo;s still outstanding.
Figuring out that the issue could surround the vCurrent part of the path, I did a bit more research, coming across another VS Community post which discusses this point, and it turns out that Microsoft have changed the MSBuildToolsVersion variable to output Current rather than the version (as it did previously).

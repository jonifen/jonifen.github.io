First of all, create a bootable USB (or CD) based on the ISO downloaded from the main Arch Linux website and boot it up.

I did a full reboot of Windows 10, and luckily this was sufficient to shake things back into life. But a quick read online suggested that some people aren&amp;rsquo;t quite as lucky in this situation.
So if a reboot doesn&amp;rsquo;t resolve the issue, what next?</description></item><item><title>Git (Source Control)</title><link>/notes/git/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/notes/git/</guid><description>Retaining chmod permissions for scripts in git repositories git update-index --chmod=+x your_bash_script.sh The git documentation provides more information on the update-index command here: https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-update-index
Clone repository including all submodules Get the latest commit in the parent repository:
git clone {repository_url} cd {repository_dir} # -- OR -- git pull And then update the submodule:
git submodule update --init --recursive This should pull the relevant commit for the submodule, but it will be in detached HEAD mode based on the commit of the submodule reference in the parent repository.</description></item><item><title>Home DIY</title><link>/notes/home-diy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/notes/home-diy/</guid><description>Developers probably aren&amp;rsquo;t typically known for their DIY ability in the home. I try to do a bit, but I know my limitations so these notes are mainly to remind me of what I&amp;rsquo;ve done and what I used to do the job.

Laptop locks up in Linux - thermal event Sometimes in Linux I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that the laptop will lock up, often in high CPU situations.</description></item><item><title>Linux</title><link>/notes/linux/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/notes/linux/</guid><description>Most of the notes in here are Arch Linux specific, as this is the distro I use most and the one which tends to give me the most curveballs to deal with! But this is what&amp;rsquo;s so good about it, as it gives me a way to learn things better than I would do with one of the more common distros like Ubuntu.
If anyone reads any of these notes and thinks there&amp;rsquo;s a better way, please let me know - any help is always appreciated.</description></item><item><title>Raspberry Pi</title><link>/notes/raspberry-pi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/notes/raspberry-pi/</guid><description>Laggy mouse on Raspberry Pi (Model 1b) A few weeks ago I installed the latest (at the time) version of Raspbian onto a 4Gb SD Card thinking that I&amp;rsquo;d see whether it was worthwhile updating my main SD card or not. I gave it a quick run and while it seemed quicker, the mouse was quite laggy as if the cursor was moving through treacle. After a quick search, I came across a report on the RaspberryPi Github where someone else was having the exact same problem where the mouse was moving &amp;ldquo;in slow motion&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Scanners</title><link>/notes/scanners/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/notes/scanners/</guid><description>PrimeFilm 1800u Film Scanner The drivers on the enclosed CD don&amp;rsquo;t work in Windows 10.

They all have slightly different setups, but the intention is that they will all eventually be set up the same.
If anyone thinks I&amp;rsquo;m missing a trick anywhere (an extension you just can&amp;rsquo;t recommend enough perhaps?), please let me know - any help is always appreciated. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;d prefer to submit a PR?

I&amp;rsquo;d found that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t capable of handling fibre broadband speeds (hardly surprising&amp;hellip; given that it&amp;rsquo;s running a 200MHz single core CPU with barely a few megs free of the 16Mb RAM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up dropping by PC World and picking up the TP-Link Archer C2 for £49.99 (a few quid more expensive than it was at Scan, but PC World was closer, so I was saving petrol money and around 30 minutes of my time for the round-trip).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Buffalo WHR-HP-G54 Fun (or not...)</title><link>/blog/buffalo-whr-hp-g54/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jan 2016 22:54:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/buffalo-whr-hp-g54/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Out of contract with my previous supplier, I was free to find a new supplier. Luckily, one of the benefits of my job is that I get free fibre broadband, so it was a simple decision :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to the point of my post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I last used the Buffalo a few years back when on Virgin Media&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;National&amp;rdquo; service (no longer available - a good thing as it was trash) when their supplied Netgear had weak wi-fi. Since then, there&amp;rsquo;s been well documented problems with OpenSSL and the &lt;a href="http://heartbleed.com"&gt;Heartbleed&lt;/a&gt; vulnerability and I was sure that the Tomato firmware running on the Buffalo would be affected. It turned out that as I was using an official release, &lt;a href="http://wisercoder.com/router-affected-heartbleed-bug"&gt;I was OK&lt;/a&gt; but I still fancied trying &lt;a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com"&gt;DD-WRT&lt;/a&gt; as it was the original reason for me buying the Buffalo in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

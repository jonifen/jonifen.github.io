      <description>Git is easily the best source control system I&amp;rsquo;ve ever used, yet it&amp;rsquo;s probably one of the more infuriating too because its power and flexibility can also land the users in a whole world of pain.
Today at work we had a scenario where a colleague needed to revert a handful of commits including a merge but there was a chance it may need re-introducing at a later date. I suggested reverting each commit with --no-commit but nobody else had heard of this argument before, hence I felt a post may be useful (although this probably requires that people visit my blog first to find it haha).</description>

      <title>Retaining chmod permissions for scripts in git repositories</title>

      <description>Our continuous delivery setup at work requires that we use bash scripts for builds that can be handled by Linux machines.
The main issue is when we create a new project, we often get &amp;ldquo;Permission Denied&amp;rdquo; errors when the CI system runs the scripts on the build agents. Usually, you&amp;rsquo;d just run chmod on a machine and try again, but this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work when the files are being pushed into a git repository, and then pulled at the other side.</description>

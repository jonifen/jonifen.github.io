This included needing to define a way of filtering the servers in the list, because they&amp;rsquo;re all saved together at the moment. As a first attempt, I opted for a simple Dropdown control and decided to make it generic using a custom React Hook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result was the creation of &lt;code&gt;useDropdown&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Moq - Setup Mock method specifying parameters of type</title><link>/blog/moq-setup-method-with-object-parameters/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 22:16:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>/blog/moq-setup-method-with-object-parameters/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When working on my GameBrowser project this evening, I wanted to verify that a method setup on a mock object had been called when a property of the parameter object was a particular value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My scenario was that I was writing a unit test for the Quake3 protocol client and within that protocol client, I build the payload to include the 4-byte prefix data, so I needed to test that it was doing that payload building part correctly. I may extract this logic out in the future if I need to, but currently it&amp;rsquo;s only used within the Quake3 protocol so it can remain here for now.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>React.js Unit Testing with Jest and Enzyme</title><link>/blog/react-unit-testing-jest-enzyme/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2017 22:34:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/react-unit-testing-jest-enzyme/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written loads of unit tests in my lifetime for C# and JavaScript, but never gotten around to writing any for testing the actual React components because there&amp;rsquo;s always been something more pressing. Time to put that right and take the plunge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up the project which resulted from the &lt;a href="/blog/post/2017/react-js-state/"&gt;React.js Continued&amp;hellip; State!&lt;/a&gt; tutorial as a starter for ten as it already has a lot of the boilerplate stuff in place.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

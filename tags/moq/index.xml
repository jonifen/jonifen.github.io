&lt;p&gt;My scenario was that I was writing a unit test for the Quake3 protocol client and within that protocol client, I build the payload to include the 4-byte prefix data, so I needed to test that it was doing that payload building part correctly. I may extract this logic out in the future if I need to, but currently it&amp;rsquo;s only used within the Quake3 protocol so it can remain here for now.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

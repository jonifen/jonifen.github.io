      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not a big DIY-er, but I do have a go from time to time. After having some home improvements work done on our house which included removing the chimney throughout the house, we&amp;rsquo;re in need of a TV aerial. We have Sky as our main TV supply on the main TV, but in the bedrooms, we relied on the aerial, so I needed to find a solution fairly soon.</description>

      <description>Sky provide a remote code tool on their website, but it can hardly be called accurate. It&amp;rsquo;s happened on a few occasions now, that I spend some time trying different codes that the tool provides for a TV, only to be left empty-handed (well, not entirely&amp;hellip; I actually end up with my hands full&amp;hellip; one remote in each hand in fact.)
So I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to create a post on here, which undoubtedly Google will spider at some point, that I&amp;rsquo;ll keep updated with every future encounter that Sky&amp;rsquo;s website doesn&amp;rsquo;t help with.</description>

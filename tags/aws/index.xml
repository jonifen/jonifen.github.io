&lt;p&gt;At work, we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a mobile app for our customers. We&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at automated testing to interact with the app like a user would on a device and came across Appium and Detox as potential options that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t cost too much to run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code&gt;dotnet lambda package -o ../../build/{DestinationFileName}.zip
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when I ran this command earlier today on a new Lambda function project, I got the following error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code&gt;No executable found matching command &amp;#34;dotnet-lambda&amp;#34;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because the Amazon.Lambda.Tools package isn&amp;rsquo;t being included in the dotnet build process, so to fix things, I had to edit the .csproj file for the Lambda function to include the following:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

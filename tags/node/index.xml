At work, we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a mobile app for our customers. We&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at automated testing to interact with the app like a user would on a device and came across Appium and Detox as potential options that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t cost too much to run.
As we primarily worked on Windows machines, Detox was out of the running as it seems to be only guaranteed support on MacOS, so we started looking at Appium instead.</description></item></channel></rss>

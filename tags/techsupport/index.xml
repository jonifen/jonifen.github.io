      <title>HP DM1-4027 and Arch Linux</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started to use a HP DM1-4027ea as a replacement for the Asus Eee 1005P netbook. The 4Gb RAM (upgradable to 8Gb) and more powerful CPU/GPU combo meant that it should give reasonable performance where the Eee struggles (downloading npm modules and browsing script/image heavy websites).
The HP DM1-4027ea comes with an AMD E-450 APU which consists of a dual core 1.6GHz CPU and a Radeon HD6320 GPU, so on paper should still be acceptable for current mobile demands.</description>

      <description>I have an aging iPad2 which is getting on a bit but still works fine, but often won&amp;rsquo;t appear in iTunes, but is showing in Windows 10 as a device in &amp;lsquo;This PC&amp;rsquo;.
I find it usually happens after an iTunes update when the iPad was plugged in already, and it seems Windows throws in a generic driver when the Apple drivers are removed as part of the upgrade process. To solve the problem, I do the following:</description>

      <description>As part of the downsizing task my Mum has taken on, we&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot of photos and slides to transfer to a digital format that can be viewed on an iPad (or digital photo frame). The photos is an easy task (albeit fairly monotonous as my scanner doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a document feeder), but the slides might be trickier.
My Mum bought a slide scanner a few years ago (OK then, quite a few years ago), the PrimeFilm 1800u Film Scanner.</description>

      <description>I have had a fair few people lately telling me that their Windows computers are struggling to connect to the Internet. After doing some digging into the problem, it turns out that it could be related to a failed Windows Update that Microsoft initially issued in December 2016, but some computers are slow in picking up the update (or the owners are similar to me, and don&amp;rsquo;t reboot very often to let updates take effect!</description>

      <description>On my XPS15, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed recently that the Intel graphics driver crashes a quite a bit (mainly when using Google Chrome). Although it recovers successfully, it&amp;rsquo;s still pretty annoying. A couple of days ago, I finally reached the end of my tether and started seriously looking for a solution (as compared to a quick Google search and then get distracted).
I came across a thread on Dell&amp;rsquo;s community forum: http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3519/t/19658452 which discussed this problem.</description>

      <description>For a while my son&amp;rsquo;s iPhone 5 has prompted for my Apple Id password everytime he tries to download a free app, or when updating his existing apps. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t always done this, so something must have changed. I had a look around online, comparing advice to the settings on his phone, and all seemed fine, but it still asked for this password.
Earlier this morning, I did a backup, a factory reset and a backup restore.</description>

      <description>So this week I&amp;rsquo;ve bought an ex-corporate Dell Vostro 3350 with the intention of it replacing Di&amp;rsquo;s aged Pentium D desktop which is struggling since the Windows 10 upgrade. The laptop came pre-installed with Windows 10 Professional (a digital entitlement upgrade from the Windows 7 Pro that came on the laptop), and seemed quick enough. However, I&amp;rsquo;m not one to use a laptop as it comes, especially when it&amp;rsquo;s not brand new.</description>

      <description>Twice recently I&amp;rsquo;ve reinstalled Windows 7 on a machine, only for Windows Update to fail when checking for updates. On both machines it gave an error 8007000E.
The first machine (belonging to my nephew), I couldn&amp;rsquo;t fix, so left it with him with automatic updates enabled in the hope it&amp;rsquo;ll fix itself.
The second machine is this Samsung netbook. As it&amp;rsquo;s already had me over a barrel, it won&amp;rsquo;t do me over again!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had to do a restore on a Samsung NC10+ which is an Atom N450 based netbook from a few years back. But for some reason, the recovery stuff just won&amp;rsquo;t work and I&amp;rsquo;ve had to do a clean install of Windows. And the Samsung support website&amp;hellip; well, it&amp;rsquo;s not much support at all. In fact, I don&amp;rsquo;t think they even remember releasing the NC10+. Only the original NC10.</description>

      <description>As mentioned in my last post, I was in the hunt for a new router to replace the aging Buffalo WHR-HP-G54. I&amp;rsquo;d found that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t capable of handling fibre broadband speeds (hardly surprising&amp;hellip; given that it&amp;rsquo;s running a 200MHz single core CPU with barely a few megs free of the 16Mb RAM).
I ended up dropping by PC World and picking up the TP-Link Archer C2 for Â£49.99 (a few quid more expensive than it was at Scan, but PC World was closer, so I was saving petrol money and around 30 minutes of my time for the round-trip).</description>

      <description>Out of contract with my previous supplier, I was free to find a new supplier. Luckily, one of the benefits of my job is that I get free fibre broadband, so it was a simple decision :)
Anyway, back to the point of my post.
I last used the Buffalo a few years back when on Virgin Media&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;National&amp;rdquo; service (no longer available - a good thing as it was trash) when their supplied Netgear had weak wi-fi.</description>

      <description>My &amp;lsquo;love affair&amp;rsquo; (if you could ever call it that) with Android has always been a little rocky (as mentioned back in June) but I&amp;rsquo;m now ready to go back to an iPhone. Being a Dad, this time of year is never exactly the right time to blow out big money on a new phone for myself so that&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait for the new year. But I&amp;rsquo;ve got hold of my daughter&amp;rsquo;s old iPhone 5c to use in the meantime.</description>

      <description>It seems whenever I need to make a phone call on the landline, it&amp;rsquo;s broken. Yesterday I picked up the landline handset and it was dead. No dial tone. Nothing. Nada. Zip.
I tried the usual steps at first (unplug it, plug it back in) but no joy. Onto the broadband I went. Works fine. Weird. I&amp;rsquo;ve had this before and leaving stuff unplugged overnight seemed to fix it, but on this occasion it didn&amp;rsquo;t help.</description>

      <description>Google brings up a complete bag of results when you search for &amp;ldquo;svchost high cpu&amp;rdquo; as it&amp;rsquo;s been a well documented issue with the Windows Update service across the last couple of Windows versions (way back to XP as it happens!) so it was little surprise to find that the instance of svchost.exe that was eating CPU cycles was the one that was hosting the Windows Update service.
Dipping into the Settings screens of Windows 10, I got to the Windows Update section, only for it to show that it was on &amp;ldquo;Downloading Updates 0%&amp;rdquo; and remained at this point for a couple of hours without moving.</description>

The error I was getting was &amp;ldquo;Error 0x800CCC13 Cannot connect to the network&amp;rdquo;. I tried a few different things, but to no avail.
After researching online, I found that doing the following fixes it: + Close Outlook before continuing. + Run a command prompt as administrator + Run sfc /scannow and allow to complete.</description>

      <description>About a fortnight ago, I changed to an android handset after having iPhones for the last 4 years. I had decided on an LG G3 which turns out to come preinstalled with McAfee Mobile Security&amp;hellip; Which is fine&amp;hellip; Or would be if it worked properly.
I use an app for my online banking. When I load it up, it complains that there is no security product installed. If I open up McAfee manually, and go back into my banking app, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t complain.</description>

As a result, we do have web services that I&amp;rsquo;d run on a VM, but it&amp;rsquo;s not possible to bridge the adapters (to allow external access to the VM) due to security guidelines at work, so I have to try something else.</description>

I gave it a quick run and while it seemed quicker, the mouse was quite laggy as if the cursor was moving through treacle. After a quick search, I came across a report on the RaspberryPi Github where someone else was having the exact same problem where the mouse was moving &amp;ldquo;in slow motion&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>We have an Asus EeePC 1005P netbook which comes with the Intel Atom N450 CPU. The BIOS provides a &amp;ldquo;Boot Booster&amp;rdquo; option which caches POST information in a special partition on the hard drive to speed up the boot process. Unfortunately, as part of removing all the partitions from the hard drive, this &amp;ldquo;special&amp;rdquo; partition has been lost and I needed to recreate it.
You will need:

After trying to persist with an Atom N450 netbook (Visual Studio usage is soul-destroying on an Atom CPU!), I&amp;rsquo;ve dug it back out and ordered a new battery from Amazon and the Intel 40Gb SSD that was on offer at Ebuyer for 20 quid.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;d looked around for drivers, but Canon haven&amp;rsquo;t made any 64-bit drivers for that camera (we have had it nearly 8 years) so I was wondering how I&amp;rsquo;d get around the problem. I eventually came across the site of someone else in the same situation who has blogged the following:</description>

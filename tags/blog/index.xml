When you start the Hugo server locally, it will show the following output:
$ hugo server -w ... (some output omitted here for brevity) ... Web Server is available at //localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1) Press Ctrl+C to stop Because it&amp;rsquo;s bound to your localhost IP, you can&amp;rsquo;t just open port 1313 on your computer via a firewall and access Hugo from another device.</description></item></channel></rss>

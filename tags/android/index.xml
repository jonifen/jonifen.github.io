&lt;p&gt;I had already installed all the relevant applications needed (Android Studio, a JDK etc.) but when I ran &lt;code&gt;react-native run-android&lt;/code&gt;, it would give me the following error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code&gt;error Failed to install the app. Make sure you have the Android development environment set up
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried a few different things until I came across &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/67360611/3157725"&gt;a solution proposed by Menon Hasan on Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; where they proposed the following command to set the executable permission on the &lt;code&gt;gradlew&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A Decent 10" Android Tablet... Does one exist?</title><link>/blog/a-decent-10-inch-android-tablet/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Jan 2016 21:02:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/a-decent-10-inch-android-tablet/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;My son bought an Android tablet around 18 months ago with a combination of Christmas and Birthday money. It became an extension of his body with him taking it everywhere to play games and watch YouTube videos about Minecraft and Garry&amp;rsquo;s Mod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He recently leapt into bed one night (forgetting the tablet was on his bed) and broke the screen with his knee. It was a complete accident, but he was absolutely devastated by what had happened. I explained that if we couldn&amp;rsquo;t get a screen, I&amp;rsquo;d pay for half of any replacement as he had looked after it so well up until the accident.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

&lt;p&gt;We use MS Notification Hub to handle our push notifications that are triggered by internal systems etc. but we wanted to achieve a situation where we were using a testing APNs environment (i.e. the sandbox) for our App Center builds, and the production APNs environment for our TestFlight/App Store builds.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

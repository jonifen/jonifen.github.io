What do you do? Pull the repo and build it yourself and shoehorn it in? Let&amp;rsquo;s see&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my example, I&amp;rsquo;ll use the griddle-react package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quite like the Griddle component (griddle-react), I&amp;rsquo;ve posted about it in the past, and use it both at work and in side-projects at home whenever tabular data needs to be displayed as it&amp;rsquo;s quick and simple. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve had it occur twice where a bug is present in the current npm package version, but since the package was pushed to npm, the bug has been fixed in the Github repository. How do I get this version into my project!?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

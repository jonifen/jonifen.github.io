I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at this since it was first announced a while back, but never actually got around to having a proper look into it and getting it installed on one of our Pis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kit do I have then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raspberry Pi 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edimax EW-7811Un Nano USB Wireless Dongle (which turned out to be unsupported, but there is a workaround - details to come later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Official Power Supply (the white Raspberry Pi 2.1A model)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all I need to get the operating system downloaded. I found the Windows IoT Dashboard software available for free from Microsoft (I downloaded it from &lt;a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/Downloads.htm"&gt;https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/Downloads.htm&lt;/a&gt;) and installed it onto my laptop ready to go. This software allowed me to specify that it is intended for running on a Raspberry Pi (it lists the Pi 2 and 3 - I assume the Pi 1 isn&amp;rsquo;t powerful enough?) so I followed the steps and created my MicroSD card ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

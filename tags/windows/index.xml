After doing some digging into the problem, it turns out that it could be related to a failed Windows Update that Microsoft initially issued in December 2016, but some computers are slow in picking up the update (or the owners are similar to me, and don&amp;rsquo;t reboot very often to let updates take effect!</description></item><item><title>Dell Vostro 3350 Laptop with Windows 10</title><link>/blog/dell-vostro-3350-windows-10/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jun 2016 22:32:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>/blog/dell-vostro-3350-windows-10/</guid><description>So this week I&amp;rsquo;ve bought an ex-corporate Dell Vostro 3350 with the intention of it replacing Di&amp;rsquo;s aged Pentium D desktop which is struggling since the Windows 10 upgrade. The laptop came pre-installed with Windows 10 Professional (a digital entitlement upgrade from the Windows 7 Pro that came on the laptop), and seemed quick enough. However, I&amp;rsquo;m not one to use a laptop as it comes, especially when it&amp;rsquo;s not brand new.</description></item><item><title>Windows Update Error 8007000E</title><link>/blog/windows-update-error-8007000e-clean-install/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2016 20:14:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/windows-update-error-8007000e-clean-install/</guid><description>Twice recently I&amp;rsquo;ve reinstalled Windows 7 on a machine, only for Windows Update to fail when checking for updates. On both machines it gave an error 8007000E.
The first machine (belonging to my nephew), I couldn&amp;rsquo;t fix, so left it with him with automatic updates enabled in the hope it&amp;rsquo;ll fix itself.
The second machine is this Samsung netbook. As it&amp;rsquo;s already had me over a barrel, it won&amp;rsquo;t do me over again!</description></item><item><title>Windows XP and it's poor effort of an "Automatic Updates" service</title><link>/blog/windows-xp-dodgy-automatic-updates/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2013 20:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/windows-xp-dodgy-automatic-updates/</guid><description>So it&amp;rsquo;s the end of a long Sunday which started later than expected (as I&amp;rsquo;d slept in despite my son&amp;rsquo;s best efforts to wake me with the ever-loud playback of YouTube videos). I&amp;rsquo;ve spent most of the day glaring at a computer screen but not for productive gain as it&amp;rsquo;s my family duty to fix the broken computers of the children/parents/siblings, except this time it&amp;rsquo;s been a looonnnnggg job which Windows XP is just aching to make so much worse.</description></item></channel></rss>

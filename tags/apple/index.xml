It hasn&amp;rsquo;t always done this, so something must have changed. I had a look around online, comparing advice to the settings on his phone, and all seemed fine, but it still asked for this password.
Earlier this morning, I did a backup, a factory reset and a backup restore.</description></item></channel></rss>

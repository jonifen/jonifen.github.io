The general advice given online is to delete all node modules for your project and re-install the packages using your preferred package manager. However, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t always solve the problem and I was in this position just a moment ago.
Luckily, in the Storybook CLI docs, there is an argument --no-manager-cache which says that it will disable the Storybook manager caching mechanism.</description></item><item><title>How to test a custom React hook component</title><link>/blog/react-js-test-custom-hook-component/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Dec 2020 10:20:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/react-js-test-custom-hook-component/</guid><description>As part of my GameBrowser side-project, I&amp;rsquo;m at the stage where I wanted to start improving the UI a bit.

I cloned a repository the other day which was using create-react-app, and an npm i installed over 2000 packages! This is a hell of a lot to download just to be able to run some code locally.</description></item></channel></rss>

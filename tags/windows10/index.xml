&lt;p&gt;Dipping into the Settings screens of Windows 10, I got to the Windows Update section, only for it to show that it was on &amp;ldquo;Downloading Updates 0%&amp;rdquo; and remained at this point for a couple of hours without moving. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember the process for fixing this issue in Windows 8 (as I have had it on another PC in the past), hence the need for Google.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>"Something went wrong" - Creating users on Windows 10</title><link>/blog/something-went-wrong-creating-users-windows10/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2015 11:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/something-went-wrong-creating-users-windows10/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;On a fresh install of Windows 10, I found I was unable to add a second user to the system (via All Settings) and constantly got the &amp;ldquo;Something went wrong&amp;rdquo; screen. I tried a few reboots but to no avail.
A quick google found that a lot of people with laptops were having this problem, and removing the battery and running on AC power only appeared to resolve their problem, but I&amp;rsquo;m on a desktop&amp;hellip; i.e. no battery.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

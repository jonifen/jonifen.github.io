Usually I&amp;rsquo;d just include an addendum at the bottom, but I&amp;rsquo;ve re-worded a few bits in the content as my original review was maybe a tad harsh, and I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why below. It&amp;rsquo;s just a shame it took so long for the Marshmallow update to be available, as I&amp;rsquo;d already had enough with the handset and wanted back to an Apple where things are just simple!</description></item><item><title>McAfee Mobile Security</title><link>/blog/mcafee-mobile-security/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2015 08:26:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/mcafee-mobile-security/</guid><description>About a fortnight ago, I changed to an android handset after having iPhones for the last 4 years. I had decided on an LG G3 which turns out to come preinstalled with McAfee Mobile Security&amp;hellip; Which is fine&amp;hellip; Or would be if it worked properly.
I use an app for my online banking. When I load it up, it complains that there is no security product installed. If I open up McAfee manually, and go back into my banking app, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t complain.</description></item></channel></rss>

It&amp;rsquo;s a great tablet for the £135 it cost at Argos and even sweeter with the £10 voucher with which he was able to get a Google Play voucher :)
Anyway, to the point of this post. When I play Minecraft Pocket Edition against him, I found the mobs were invisible and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even hear any creepers or spiders, I just got exploded or bit by them silently. I thought this was a little odd, and after searching for information at the time, I was unable to find anything about it. Until now.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

      <description>My son recently bought an Acer A3-A10 tablet with some money he had saved. It&amp;rsquo;s a great tablet for the £135 it cost at Argos and even sweeter with the £10 voucher with which he was able to get a Google Play voucher :) Anyway, to the point of this post. When I play Minecraft Pocket Edition against him, I found the mobs were invisible and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t even hear any creepers or spiders, I just got exploded or bit by them silently.</description>

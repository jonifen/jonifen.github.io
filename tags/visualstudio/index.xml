Sure you might get some issues with modules not loading, but on the whole this technique allows you to debug your application through IIS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with dotnet core applications, things are a little different as they&amp;rsquo;re not ran as managed code from within a &lt;code&gt;w3wp.exe&lt;/code&gt; instance but instead from within a &lt;code&gt;dotnet.exe&lt;/code&gt; instance, so this is the process you should attach your Visual Studio instance to when debugging dotnet core.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The imported project ".../Microsoft.WebApplication.targets" was not found</title><link>/blog/vs2019-webapplication-targets-not-found/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2019 21:59:33 +0100</pubDate><guid>/blog/vs2019-webapplication-targets-not-found/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We have an existing web application project at work which was failing to open in Visual Studio 2019 with the following error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;code&gt;The imported project &amp;#34;C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Professional\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\vCurrent\WebApplications\Microsoft.WebApplication.targets&amp;#34; was not found.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;After some research, I came across this a &lt;a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/414282/vs-2019-webapplication-projects-fail-to-load.html"&gt;VS Community post&lt;/a&gt; where Microsoft have deemed it to be under consideration, but after a few months, it&amp;rsquo;s still outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figuring out that the issue could surround the &lt;code&gt;vCurrent&lt;/code&gt; part of the path, I did a bit more research, coming across another &lt;a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/404485/vs2019-msbuildtoolsversion-is-not-a-version.html"&gt;VS Community post&lt;/a&gt; which discusses this point, and it turns out that Microsoft have changed the &lt;code&gt;MSBuildToolsVersion&lt;/code&gt; variable to output &lt;code&gt;Current&lt;/code&gt; rather than the version (as it did previously). Luckily, Jim Waite has posted &lt;a href="https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/comments/477080/view.html"&gt;a useful workaround&lt;/a&gt; which appears to have fixed the problem I was having (which I quote):&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>JSX/ES6 Syntax Highlighting in Visual Studio 2015</title><link>/blog/jsx-highlighting-vs2015/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2017 20:02:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/jsx-highlighting-vs2015/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Visual Studio 2015 (by default) isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly crash hot for editing JavaScript, especially JSX/ES6 for React etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of developers seem to opt for alternative IDEs/editors for writing JavaScript code instead of staying in Visual Studio, however it&amp;rsquo;s often more effort to manage multiple IDEs for one project. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a few things myself to get things working, some of the steps below are courtesy of Nick Dewitt on &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34097915/visual-studio-2015-jsx-es2015-syntax-highlighting/36321109#36321109"&gt;this StackOverflow post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Connection problems in Visual Studio 2013</title><link>/blog/visual-studio-2013-connection-problems/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2014 12:31:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/visual-studio-2013-connection-problems/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Since installing Update 2 on the work laptop, I&amp;rsquo;ve been unable to check for available updates through the Tools &amp;gt; Extensions &amp;amp; Updates screen as it always timed out.
If I continued working (without closing the IDE), it would eventually prompt me through the Notifications pane that it required credentials for the company proxy. Once I did that, it&amp;rsquo;d report updates etc. but over the last couple of days, that is no longer happening either.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>

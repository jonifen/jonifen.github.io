I&amp;rsquo;d found that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t capable of handling fibre broadband speeds (hardly surprising&amp;hellip; given that it&amp;rsquo;s running a 200MHz single core CPU with barely a few megs free of the 16Mb RAM).
I ended up dropping by PC World and picking up the TP-Link Archer C2 for ¬£49.99 (a few quid more expensive than it was at Scan, but PC World was closer, so I was saving petrol money and around 30 minutes of my time for the round-trip).</description></item><item><title>Buffalo WHR-HP-G54 Fun (or not...)</title><link>/blog/buffalo-whr-hp-g54/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jan 2016 22:54:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/buffalo-whr-hp-g54/</guid><description>Out of contract with my previous supplier, I was free to find a new supplier. Luckily, one of the benefits of my job is that I get free fibre broadband, so it was a simple decision :)
Anyway, back to the point of my post.
I last used the Buffalo a few years back when on Virgin Media&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;National&amp;rdquo; service (no longer available - a good thing as it was trash) when their supplied Netgear had weak wi-fi.</description></item><item><title>No dial tone, but broadband still works?</title><link>/blog/no-dial-tone-but-broadband-works/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2015 20:58:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/no-dial-tone-but-broadband-works/</guid><description>It seems whenever I need to make a phone call on the landline, it&amp;rsquo;s broken. Yesterday I picked up the landline handset and it was dead. No dial tone. Nothing. Nada. Zip.
I tried the usual steps at first (unplug it, plug it back in) but no joy. Onto the broadband I went. Works fine. Weird. I&amp;rsquo;ve had this before and leaving stuff unplugged overnight seemed to fix it, but on this occasion it didn&amp;rsquo;t help.</description></item></channel></rss>

      <description>We had a requirement at work to display some tabular data that is retrieved from a web service as a JSON object. As we have recently started using React, it made sense to find a decent component that suited what we needed and after a bit of browsing, we found Griddle.
Unfortunately, their documentation; while it wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad, it&amp;rsquo;s not the best I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d throw something together to show how to get it working quickly and using a publicly available API, so anyone should be able to follow.</description>

      <title>React.js Unit Testing with Jest and Enzyme</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written loads of unit tests in my lifetime for C# and JavaScript, but never gotten around to writing any for testing the actual React components because there&amp;rsquo;s always been something more pressing. Time to put that right and take the plunge.
So I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up the project which resulted from the React.js Continued&amp;hellip; State! tutorial as a starter for ten as it already has a lot of the boilerplate stuff in place.</description>

      <title>Rendering an array of data as a clickable list using React.js</title>
      <link>/blog/post/2017/reactjs-render-clickable-lists/</link>

      <description>React.js is great for quickly rendering arrays of data in a tabular format, and there&amp;rsquo;s loads of grid-like packages out there in npm, but sometimes you just need to hand-crank something yourself. Which is fine, until you want the row to be clickable&amp;hellip;
So how would you usually render a page from an array of data? Well, I&amp;rsquo;d probably start with some form of iterating the array and building up the content that way.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve created a few pages on here which are now growing into a bit of a tutorial, so thought I&amp;rsquo;d collate the links into one post (and append links to any new related posts in the future) so it&amp;rsquo;s easier to follow.
So to start off, I&amp;rsquo;ll rewind back to November 2015, when I created my Getting Started with React.js post. This was using JSX and ES5, along with Browserify to &amp;ldquo;compile&amp;rdquo; the code to &amp;ldquo;Vanilla JS&amp;rdquo; which the web browsers support.</description>

      <description>This time I&amp;rsquo;ll be looking at State. What it is and how to use it&amp;hellip; Like last time, we&amp;rsquo;ll be continuing with the code from the previous post.
Last time we created 2 components, home (which was a stateful component) and header (which was a stateless component). This time we&amp;rsquo;re going to handle state within the home component by calling an API. As in previous posts, I&amp;rsquo;ll be using the UK Police API as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any authentication (or at least it doesn&amp;rsquo;t at the moment, that could change!</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to continue on from my React.js Revisited post that I made a few days ago. This time we&amp;rsquo;ll look at creating some components&amp;hellip;
So what exactly is a &amp;ldquo;Component&amp;rdquo; in the context of React.js? In my head, I visualise React.js a little like Web UI Lego. The idea is you build your web application in blocks which are then built in a way which suits you and your application.</description>

      <description>Edit 05/03/2017 - My son has kindly followed this mini tutorial and has pointed out a few areas where I didn&amp;rsquo;t make much sense. All part of learning! But I&amp;rsquo;ve updated those areas below.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote up my beginner guide to React.js and I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking it&amp;rsquo;s time to revisit it as things have changed since then with better tooling and ES6 support etc. so here I am!</description>

      <title>npm package.json - Package From a Github Commit</title>

      <description>Sometimes the version of an npm package has some functionality you want, but it has issues which break other stuff. What do you do? Pull the repo and build it yourself and shoehorn it in? Let&amp;rsquo;s see&amp;hellip;
For my example, I&amp;rsquo;ll use the griddle-react package.
I quite like the Griddle component (griddle-react), I&amp;rsquo;ve posted about it in the past, and use it both at work and in side-projects at home whenever tabular data needs to be displayed as it&amp;rsquo;s quick and simple.</description>

      <title>JSX/ES6 Syntax Highlighting in Visual Studio 2015</title>

      <description>Visual Studio 2015 (by default) isn&amp;rsquo;t exactly crash hot for editing JavaScript, especially JSX/ES6 for React etc.
A lot of developers seem to opt for alternative IDEs/editors for writing JavaScript code instead of staying in Visual Studio, however it&amp;rsquo;s often more effort to manage multiple IDEs for one project. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a few things myself to get things working, some of the steps below are courtesy of Nick Dewitt on this StackOverflow post.</description>

      <title>Inline styles with React</title>
      <link>/blog/post/2015/inline-styles-react/</link>

      <guid>/blog/post/2015/inline-styles-react/</guid>
      <description>While working on the Griddle functionality at work, we needed to throw in some inline styling (just to test something out quickly). Unfortunately, with React, this isn&amp;rsquo;t as straightforward as just throwing in a style attribute with a few values.
The React documentation does explain this, but I&amp;rsquo;m not impressed with having to create a variable just for a quick sweaty test of something. Instead, you can do this:
&amp;lt;div style={{&amp;quot;height&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;100%&amp;quot;}}&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;  By putting the style markup inside double curly braces, it does away with the requirement for another variable, which makes it ideal for quickly testing a new style.</description>

      <title>Griddle - A Grid/Table Component for React</title>
      <link>/blog/post/2015/griddle-a-gridtable-component-for-react/</link>

      <guid>/blog/post/2015/griddle-a-gridtable-component-for-react/</guid>
      <description>We had a requirement at work to display some tabular data that is retrieved from a web service as a JSON object. As we have recently started using React, it made sense to find a decent component that suited what we needed and after a bit of browsing, we found Griddle.
Unfortunately, their documentation; while it wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad, it&amp;rsquo;s not the best I&amp;rsquo;ve seen so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d throw something together to show how to get it working quickly and using a publicly available API, so anyone should be able to follow.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with React.js</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been following the &amp;ldquo;Getting Started&amp;rdquo; tutorials on the ReactJS website. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit&amp;hellip; errr&amp;hellip; bizarre to be honest! It does say that the way it does things is a little odd, and to give it 5 minutes and then make a decision. Despite this &amp;ldquo;odd-ness&amp;rdquo; though, it&amp;rsquo;s become really popular, so it&amp;rsquo;s well worth having a look at.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been having a few problems with the tutorial though. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain where things haven&amp;rsquo;t gone well and what I did to fix it.</description>

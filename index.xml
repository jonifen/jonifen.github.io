I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Developer using C#, JavaScript (including React and Redux).
I started out creating mini utilities in MS Access (hey, that&amp;rsquo;s all I had access to in work at the time!) to make my work easier back in the mid 2000s before becoming a VB6 developer in 2007.
Outside of work, I&amp;rsquo;m married and a Dad of 4.
I enjoy cycling, and try to get out for a ride when I can.</description></item><item><title>How I Built My Custom Hugo Pagination</title><link>/blog/how-i-built-my-custom-hugo-pagination/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 21:46:16 +0100</pubDate><guid>/blog/how-i-built-my-custom-hugo-pagination/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning on improving the pagination control for my blog for some time, but it always seemed a bigger job than I really wanted to work on in my spare time, but I was wrong. The only complexity was around the weird templating syntax that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really got to grips with fully yet.
So I did some research first, why re-invent the wheel right? And I came across a really good tutorial from Glenn McComb where he went through how he built his, and seeing his examples, along with his explanations, made the syntax sink in better.</description></item><item><title>View Hugo served content on another device on network</title><link>/blog/view-hugo-served-content-on-lan/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Sep 2020 14:18:01 +0100</pubDate><guid>/blog/view-hugo-served-content-on-lan/</guid><description>When you want to view content served by a locally running instance of Hugo on another device, you have to specify a few extra things so it will work correctly.
